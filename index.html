                    <h3>
                        What Government Programs are available for First Time Home Buyers?
                    </h3>

<p>For first time home buyers, any form of financial or planning incentive is a great way to make home buying easier and memorable. Investing in one’s first home is a big financial commitment, something that takes some first time home buyers a number of years to make into a reality. The Canadian government, on all levels, has created a number of programs that first time home buyers can take advantage of. What these provide is accessible resources to help make buying a first property easy and manageable.</p>

<p>Take a look at the various programs below:</p>

<p><b>First Time Home Buyer’s Tax Credit (HBTC)</b><br/>

The first time home buyer’s tax credit is a non-refundable tax credit, based on an amount of $5,000, for certain home buyers that acquire a qualifying home after January 27, 2009 (i.e., generally means that the closing is after this date). By entering $5,000 to one’s personal taxes on line 369, home buyers receive a rebate of $750. This amount must be the total claimed amount between you and your spouse.</p>

<p>The credit is designed to help first time home buyers with various expenses related to home buying, such as closing costs, inspections, legal work, taxes, etc. To qualify for the HBTC, you or your spouse has acquired a qualifying home and you did not live in another home owned by you or your spouse in the year of acquisition or four years prior. A qualifying home is described as “a housing unit located in Canada acquired after January 27, 2009, which can be existing homes or those being constructed”. A share in co-operative would also qualify.</p>

<p><b>Home Buyer's Plan for First Time Home Buyers</b><br/>

The Home Buyer’s Plan by the federal government provides home buyers, especially first time home buyers, the ability to withdraw money from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) tax free to buy or build a qualifying home. Home buyers are eligible to take up to $25,000. However, contributions must remain in the RRSP for at least 90 days before you can withdraw under the Home Buyers’ Plan, and no deductible can be made for any year.</p>

The following requirements must be met to withdraw funds from your RRSP:

<ul>
<li>Qualifying home cannot be owned for more than 30 days before the withdrawal is made, by you or your spouse.</li>
<li>A maximum of $25,000 can be withdrawn</li>
<li>You have to be a resident of Canada.</li>
<li>You have to complete Form T1036 for each eligible withdrawal.</li>
<li>You have to receive all withdrawals in the same calendar year.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to point out that if you are buying a house with a spouse, the spouse is eligible to take out $25,000 as well. Any funds taken out from an RRSP must be repaid within 15 years, with 1/15 being the payment amount per year. Payments begin the second year from which the funds were withdrawn.</p>

<p>The home buyers’ plan provides first time home buyers with much needed financial flexibility when purchasing a new home. The $25,000 – or $50,000 if taken by the spouse as well – can be used towards the down-payment of a first home, a required step towards owning a home for first time home buyers.</p>

<p><b>Land Transfer Tax Refunds for First Time Home Buyers</b><br/>
The Government of Ontario provides a refund program for first time home buyers who purchase a home in the province. This interest-free refund is on the land transfer tax in Ontario, with a maximum sum of $2000. Applications for this refund must be made within 18 months after the date of the transfer. To qualify, home buyers must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>must occupy the home as your principal residence within 9 months of the date of transfer</li>
<li>must be at least 18 years of age</li>
<li>you cannot have ever owned a home, or an interest in a home, anywhere in the world. This applies to your spouse during the period which she/he is your spouse</li>
<li>in the case of a newly constructed home, where the agreement of purchase and sale was entered into before December 14, 2007, you must be entitled to a Tarion New Home Warranty</li>
</ul>

<p>The City of Toronto provides its own Municipal Land Transfer Tax rebate, which comes into effect on top of the provincial land transfer tax. First time home buyers are eligible for this rebate on the purchase of newly constructed or resale property, with a maximum of $3,725 in rebate available.</p>

<h3>
    What is the difference between a freehold home and a condominium residence?
</h3>
<p>
In a freehold residence, the homeowner own both the house and the plot of land it sits on. In a condominium however, the land belongs to a Home Owners Association (HOA), where residents are obliged to pay monthly maintenance fees while sharing ownership of the common spaces, such as the gym, yard, etc. As one would expect, freehold properties tend to be more expensive as owning land is the most lucrative part of your house purchase, because the demand for a plot of land will always increase. As the supply of land is fixed and demand is only set to go up, (thanks to urbanization and population growth), land proves to be a primary driver behind a higher resale value of a house. In a condo, you only share ownership in the common areas.
</p>

<p>In a freehold house, you have complete and utter freedom to transform the space any way you wish – with the unbridled potential to grow your investment. Whether that means undertaking a kitchen redesign, installing a deck or even constructing a new addition to the house. Unlike freeholds, condos offer far fewer opportunities to increase the resale value through renovations. Apart from renovations made to flooring, appliances and select interior finishes, HOAs place restrictions on major renovation changes (restrictions vary from one condominium residence to the other).</p>
<p>The advantage for condo owners, is under the helm of a condominium corporation, various aspects building maintenance is covered through condos fees, from electrical and piping repairs to garbage pickup and landscaping.By ensuring the building is well managed and in a top-notch condition, your investment and resale value remains strong.</p>
<p>When owning a freehold, the task of maintaining the condition of the property falls on the owner. Security, insulation and plumbing, along with lawn upkeep is the responsibility of the homeowner. Plus, houses are more prone to damages with an expensive and time-intensive fix, whereas in a condo, damages are taken care of stress free through condo fees.</p>

<h3>What are the costs involved with selling a home?</h3>

<p>In Toronto’s hot real estate market, where bidding wars and habitual price spikes fall within the territory of home buying, those looking to sell can almost certainly expect to turn a large profit.</p>
<p>Yet, long before you hammer down the ‘for sale’ sign on your lawn, it’s important to take into account all the costs associated with putting your home out on the market.</p>
<p>Between paying realtor commissions, lawyer fees and not to mention, moving costs, it’s critical that homeowners ask themselves what is the cost of selling my house? If overlooked, you can end up spending more than you bargained for, just to sell your home.</p>

<p><b>Realtor Commissions:</b><br/>
For the majority of people, the most apparent cost of selling a home are realtor commissions.
As a home seller, the cost of paying realtor commission solely rests on you, as those on the buyer’s side of the transaction contribute nothing towards the agent commission.</p>
<p>The standard commission rate in the GTA hovers around 5% of your home’s selling price, with 2.5% going towards your listing agent and the remaining 2.5% going to the buyer’s agent.</p>
<p>As the average price of a home in the GTA is currently around $596,163, you can expect to pay around $29,808 in commissions when selling your house.</p>

<p><i>Tips on how to save on commissions:</i>
<ol>
    <li>TheRedPin One program eliminates the seller’s side of the commission for those selling and buying a home at the same time. That mean home sellers will pay 2.5% in commission versus the stand 5%, which translates to about $12,500 in savings, (as an average Toronto home buyer) while still having access to TheRedPin’s top not-notch listings services.</li>
    <li>Rather than paying the standard 5% commission rate, you can negotiate with realtors to bring that percentage down.</li>
    <li>You can also overcome real estate commissions altogether by selling your home without an agent. Yet, it’s important to understand that on average, for sale by owner properties sell for an estimated 22% less than agent-assisted transactions. You’ll also miss out on inside tips and tricks and key advice that only experienced professionals are privy to on how to sell your house.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Legal costs for selling a house:</b><br/>
From ensuring your funds are properly received from the buyer to checking that no lawsuits are pending against the property, having a lawyer on your side when selling your home is critical.</p>
<p>As a home selling expense, legal services can cost you anywhere between $500 to $2,000, depending on the complexity of your deal.</p>

<p><b>Home staging and renovations:</b><br/>
Home staging is the art of leaving potential buyers with a great impression of your home regardless of the address and price tag.</p>
<p>While it's difficult to pinpoint the average cost of home staging, (as it’s up to you as a seller on whether you want to hire a staging consultation or rent furniture), it’s important that you establish a clear budget on how much you want to spend on staging – if any at all – to ensure you don’t overspend.</p>
<p>Many home sellers also chose to renovate their homes before putting it on the market in order to increase its resale value. In such cases, keeping a close eye on costs and choosing the the best home upgrades for resale are key, to ensuring your home improvements will have a positive impact on your bottom line when you eventually sell. No home seller wants to be put in a situation where they don’t make back the money they spent on their home renovations.</p>

<p><b>Bank costs:</b><br/>
Depending on your mortgage structure and your relationship with your bank, you may be subject to pay certain costs when selling a house with a mortgage. Specifically fees to discharge your mortgage.</p>
<p>Discharging fees comes into play if you either plan to leave your current bank to get a mortgage with a competing lender, end your mortgage early or if you’re looking to transfer your mortgage to a new property or title. If you’re planning on buying a new home after selling, you may be able to transfer your mortgage at no cost.</p>

<p><b>Home inspection costs:</b><br/>While the responsibility of paying for a home inspection doesn’t necessarily rest on the seller, as buyers will often pick up the tab, it’s not uncommon for sellers to cover the costs.</p>
<p>Home inspections can cost anywhere between $300 to $700.</p>

<p><b>Moving costs:</b><br/>Even if you’re lucky enough to know someone with a truck, the cost of moving can quickly balloon upwards of $1,000, depending on how much stuff you plan to move and where? Between truck rentals and hiring movers – not to mention the storage costs (if you need it), it’s critical that you account for moving costs when selling your home.
</p>
<p>If you plan on hiring professional movers, it’s recommend you get a quote for total moving costs, in writing beforehand.
</p>

<h3>What does the “Cooling Off” period refer to when buying a pre-construction condo?</h3>
<p>In Ontario, buyers are given a 10-day “cooling off period” after making their first deposit on a pre-construction condo; this short period of time is offered so buyers can get their finances in order and make sure they can and want to move forward with the purchase. During this time, it’s a good idea for you – the buyer – to get your real estate lawyer to review your Agreement of Purchase and Sale; this is a legal contract with terms and conditions that must be met, and a lawyer can make sure you understand its entirety before you sign the dotted line and agree to something you don’t understand.

                        What are the biggest mortgage mistakes homebuyers should avoid?
                    </h3>
                    
<p><b>Not getting pre-approved </b><br/>Although a mortgage pre-approval isn’t a must and even if you think with 100% certainty you’ll qualify for a mortgage, it’s always a good idea to go through the full process to get a financial reality check on what you can afford. In fact, you should actually apply for a loan before you buy a home. If a lender verifies all your information, checks your credit, and agrees to make a loan, that’ll make the home-buying process much easier. Also, many lenders will hold your mortgage rate for a certain period of time, as much as anywhere between 60 and 120 days.</p>

<p><b>Not shopping around </b><br/>You’ve probably been with the same bank for your entire life. Your parents opened the account for you when you were a kid and you remember having a little bankbook with the bank mascot on it. Surely they’re going to provide you with the best rate that’s out there for being a loyal customer. Sadly, this isn’t case. Your bank can only offer their own products and more often than not, there are better rates out there. That’s why you need to do some comparison shopping and search for the best mortgage rates.</p>

<p><b>Waiting for a better rate </b><br/>Hoping mortgage rates will drop is a gamble and could cost you in the long run. The housing market hasn’t slowed down, especially in Toronto and Vancouver. And Ottawa has tightened mortgage rules a number of times since 2008. Remember 35-year and 40-year mortgage amortization periods? They’re no longer available. Also, the minimum down payment on homes priced between $500,000 and $999,999 will increase as of Feb. 15. And if you’re waiting for a better fixed rate, sometimes rates will go up when it’s a slow time of year, such as winter. The banks aren’t as aggressive with rates when fewer people are buying homes.</p>

<p><b>Applying for more credit </b><br/>If you’ve been pre-approved, your mortgage and the interest rate are guaranteed, right? Sadly, this isn’t the case. Your pre-approval is only good with the current conditions at the time you were pre-approved. That means you shouldn’t apply for more credit, switch jobs, or use up your existing credit line.</p>

<p><b>Not budgeting for closing costs and extra expenses </b><br/>When you buy a home, there are legal and administrative expenses you need to pay. These are called closing costs, which include legal fees, title insurance, and the land transfer tax. Expect to shell out between 1.5% and 4% of the purchase price of the property. These costs aren’t included as part of your mortgage. And if you’re pre-approved for a hefty mortgage, that doesn’t mean you should get the most expensive property you can afford. If you buy a condo, it’s likely your monthly fees will rise over time. And there are unexpected costs when buying a house, especially if the roof or furnace needs to be replaced. You should budget for these extra expenses just in case.</p>



                    <h3>
                        What are caps on levies?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Caps on levies apply to pre-construction properties. 
A condo or home developer must make payments to the local government in response to new infrastructure and residents entering a neighbourhood. These development levies contribute toward everything from parks, education, meter hookups, sewers, water lines, roads and other infrastructure improvements in the neighbourhood. Pre-construction condo buyers contribute toward these levy payments.
                    </p>

                    <p>By placing a cap on levies, buyers will only pay what was formally agreed upon in a contract and not have to spend more towards unexpected price hikes.</p>

                    <h3>What is a condo Status Certificate and why do I need it?</h3>

                    <p>A status certificate is essentially a health report of the building, its reserves, any upcoming renovations, both minor and major (usually referred to as a special assessment), and any lawsuits that may affect maintenance fees. The reason it is important is to inform a prospective buyer of the fees involved so they can budget accordingly. Without the status certificate, they may not know that maintenance fees may jump up by any amount for any of the above listed reasons.</p>

<h3>What are the differences between condo and house insurance?</h3>
<p>Technically “home insurance” covers your place of residence, be that a single family home, condo, cottage, seasonal home, etc.; but don’t be fooled! Not all policies cover the same things. It depends on the type of dwelling. Home insurance for a house differs greatly from home insurance for a condo. Let’s look at six key aspects that distinguish these two types of insurance from one another. An overview below summarizes key differences that you have to know.</p>
<p><b>Policies involved in the coverage</b>
<ul><li>House: most home insurance policies consist of one component.</li>
<li>Condo: condo insurance is built of two components. First is the personal insurance side. This covers the interior of your unit. The second component is the commercial condo policy which is put in place by the condo corporation. This covers common areas such as pool, elevators, building exterior, roof etc.</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Price</b>
<ul>
    <li>House: a house insurance policy can easily cost double that of condo insurance, for the same square footage as a condo. This is because it covers more risks (e.g. your house, gardener, pool etc.).</li>
    <li>Condo: you’ll pay less for condo owner insurance because you are protecting only a portion while sharing in the costs of the rest of the structure. This is one reason condo living is so attractive for some people. In fact, the average personal condo insurance policy in Canada costs around $27 to $33 per month, but can be as low as $20 a month. Paying more than $35/month? Have an insurance broker look into other policies so you can save money.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Building Coverage</b>
<ul>
    <li>House: the structure and the building envelope are covered by the same policy.</li>
    <li>Condo: with condo insurance, the commercial policy covers the majority of the building envelope, which pertains to outdoor cladding, siding, roofing and windows. If your windows are damaged or roof shingles blown away or the parking lot is ruined, this will fall under the commercial policy scope, however, if theft occurs from your locker, your unit is robbed, or the walls inside your condo are damaged, your personal condo insurance policy comes into play.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Adjacent Area</b>
<ul>
    <li>House: You can add multiple riders to your home insurance policy to cover landscaping, gardens, trees, and even flooding.</li>
    <li>Condo: Your personal condo insurance only covers your unit – nothing else.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Other Structures</b>
<ul>
    <li>House: if you have several buildings on your property, such as a garden shed or detached garage, these can be protected under your house insurance policy.</li>
    <li>Condo: your condo insurance policy does not cover anything outside of your condo unit with the exception of your locker. If your condo includes a locker, be sure to tell your insurance broker so it can be covered.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Claim Processing</b>
<ul>
    <li>House: house insurance claims are straightforward and usually processed very quickly.</li>
    <li>Condo: condo insurance can be more complicated if a claim involves the unit owner and the condo corporation at the same time. There are simply more details to sort out since, in most cases, both your unit and common areas have been affected. For example, leakages through a balcony door or pipe that bursts in a wall involve both your policy and the condo corporation’s policy.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>While there are several key differences between condo and homeowners insurance, no one place is better than another to call home. It all depends on your needs and lifestyle. All you have to worry about is that you have the right insurance in place, regardless of if you are enjoying the convenience of a condo or the pride of single-family home ownership.</p>

<p>Remember, too, that every condo corporation is different. You must know what they cover and what’s up to you to cover. Ask for help from your lawyer and realtor to sort through condo documents to ensure you understand both your responsibilities as a unit owner, and your liabilities.</p>

<h3>What is a home inspection and should I do one?</h3>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than buying a house only to find a slew of problems and defects with the property weeks or even years down the line. To avoid the headaches of having to deal with unexpected and costly fixes in the future, have a professional home inspector look at the property before making an offer on a house.</p>
<p>Home inspections are always recommended. While the duties of a professional home inspector will vary depending on the home type (e.g. house vs condo), overall, an inspector will spot any signs of mold, water damage, potential structural and foundation issues, as well as signs of pests. Investigations into possible electrical or piping damages should also be covered.</p>
<p>Remember, while the property may look pristine during the open house, a number of serious issues may be lurking behind the scenes, so take steps to ensure an inspection is done.</p>
<p>While in a seller’s market, such as in Toronto, buyers may assume waiving the inspection will speed along the purchasing process, appease the seller and better secure their chances of having their offer approved – it’s never a smart move to skip an inspection. After all, buying a home is the largest purchase you’ll make in your life, so it’s critical you protect yourself, and your future investment.</p>

<h3>Is the down payment process the same for resale and pre-construction homes?</h3>
<p>Buying a pre-construction condo is a lot different than buying a resale condo. The first key difference is the deposit structure. If you were buying a resale condo, you would simply make a small deposit – minimum 5% in Toronto – and then make the rest of your down payment on your closing day. When you buy a pre-construction condo, however, you’ll likely have to make multiple deposit instalment throughout the time of construction, up until your final closing date.</p>

<h3>Are closing dates the same for resale and pre-construction properties?</h3>
<p>Simply put, no. When you buy a resale property, you have just one closing date: the day you make your final payments and pick up the keys. If you buy a pre-construction unit, however, your transaction can come with two closing dates: the occupancy closing date and the final closing date. If you buy a unit that happens to be completed before the others, you may be able to move in after the occupancy closing date. But it’s not until the final closing date that you become the legal owner. You cannot start making mortgage payments until after the final closing date so, if you move in before then, you have to pay the builder a monthly occupancy fee.</p>

<h3>What is a Buyer Representation Agreement? </h3>
<p>A Buyer Representation Agreement is a contract that formalizes your relationship as a homebuyer with your Realtor®. By signing a B.R.A, you enter a legal agreement with a real estate brokerage to work exclusively with one Realtor® for a designated period of time. In turn, you receive the unbridled commitment of an agent to find you the exact home you’re looking for.</p>
<p>The Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA) produces B.R.A forms within the province.</p>
<p>The real benefit of a B.R.A is that it clarifies your expectations from the Realtor®, in writing.</p>
<p>In the Buyer Representation Agreement, you can detail everything out from the exact property type you’re looking for, to your desired geographical location, to home must-haves. This not only removes any room for potential miscommunication, but also contractually commits your Realtor® to find the right residence for you. Therefore, guaranteeing that you’re not forced to buy a new property that doesn’t fit your needs.
</p>
<p>The Buyer Representation Agreement also fully entitles you to have complete access to all of the Realtor’s® knowledge about the neighbourhood and the market place.
Better yet, the B.R.A protects your interest as all the information you provide to your Realtor® is kept confidential, even from the seller.</p>
<p>While there are benefits to signing a B.R.A, by doing so you are legally obligated to work exclusively with one Realtor® for a specific time frame. Therefore, it’s wise not to skip over thoroughly reading the terms and conditions, which may end up locking you in a contract with a Realtor® that is wrong for you. Moreover, it restricts your freedom to change agents for however long the Buyer Representation Agreement stipulates.</p>
<p><b>Can I cancel a BRA?</b><br/>
If you sign a representation agreement then later decide that you’re not satisfied with the services provided by your Realtor®, or simply wish to work with another agent, the obvious question to ask is how do I terminate the B.R.A?</p>
<p>As a legal contract, signing a Representation Agreement legally locks you to the contract for a certain period time. While some agents may agree to cancel the agreement early, they are not legally obliged to do so and can face legal actions.</p>
<p>How do you avoid the repercussions of breaking a Buyer Representation Agreement contract?</p>
<p>Working with a real estate agent you can trust is key. Make sure to read agent profiles and interview as many agents as possible until you find one that has your best interest in mind.</p>
<p>You’ll know you choose the right Realtor® if he or she clearly explains the details of all legal documentation before anything is signed, while also granting you the freedom to break the Representation Agreement at anytime, without any consequences.</p>
<p>The first sign of an untrustworthy agent is one that glazes through paperwork without fully briefing you on the specific terms and conditions. Plus, having overall experience agent in the field, with great relationship skills and positive feedback from past clients is all part of the package of a great agent.
</p>
<p>Another key factor is ensuring that you read the terms and conditions of the Buyer Representation Agreement on your own before deciding to sign on the dotted line. Skimming the paperwork is not enough as you’ll miss important details from the expiry date to the terms of cancellation and more.</p>

                        What are the closing costs involved with buying in pre-construction properties?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
Pre-construction closing costs are lawyer’s fees, levies and occupancy fees, which is an interim occupancy that does not go towards the mortgage. When the building is registered, a mortgage will be required, until then, you may be paying rent. The interim occupancy is a percentage of the unpaid mortgage, estimated taxes and maintenance fees.
